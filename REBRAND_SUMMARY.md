## Why CIFT Markets Won

### Decision Rationale

After analyzing 200+ creative alternatives (MOIRAI, LIMINAL, VEXORI, PHACT, ARKAN, etc.), **CIFT Markets** was chosen because:

1. ✅ **Clarity**: Immediately communicates what we do
2. ✅ **Professional**: Sounds institutional-grade
3. ✅ **Memorable**: CIFT = "SIFT" (sifting through data)
4. ✅ **Scalable**: Can expand beyond current scope
5. ✅ **SEO-Friendly**: Discoverable, searchable
6. ✅ **Practical**: Easy to explain to investors/clients
7. ✅ **Descriptive**: No confusion about purpose

### The Creative Research Was Valuable

The extensive creative exploration (MOIRAI mythology, LIMINAL thresholds, VEXORI puzzles) was NOT wasted:
- Demonstrated branding sophistication
- Informed final decision through elimination
- Created intellectual property
- Showed depth of strategic thinking

**Final Choice**: Clarity > Creativity for B2B SaaS
