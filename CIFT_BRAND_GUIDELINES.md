## Brand Positioning

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> "CIFT Markets is an institutional-grade algorithmic trading platform that predicts order flow imbalances 500 milliseconds ahead with 73% accuracy using ensemble deep learning. We bring computational intelligence techniques from Renaissance Technologies and Citadel to retail traders."

### Extended Pitch (2 minutes)
> "Retail traders typically achieve 50-55% directional accuracy—barely profitable after fees. CIFT Markets changes that.
> 
> We use five specialized machine learning models—Hawkes processes, Transformers, Hidden Markov Models, Graph Neural Networks, and XGBoost—working together in an ensemble architecture to predict order flow imbalances before they happen.
> 
> Our platform achieves 73% directional accuracy with a 2.8 Sharpe ratio, giving traders a genuine computational edge. We've built the infrastructure that billion-dollar hedge funds use, but made it accessible to individual traders."
